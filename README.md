# TimeComplexity

Takes in a python file and gives it a time complexity in big O notation. 

Disclaimer: This program only takes in very simple code. It will most likely not accurately give proper results for higher level code. The time complexity given will be limited to only include powers of n and logn. (ex. O(n^2*logn))
